# CD Track 0 Ripping Tool

Currently a work in progress. I found a routine to extract CD tracks in C++ and modified it to extract the pregap of Track 1. This is where hidden tracks can be found. To use, insert a CD and select the drive directory. Choose where to save the .wav file and click "Extract".
